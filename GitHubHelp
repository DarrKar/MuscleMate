When first cloning the project:
  1. Click on "Clone or download" button and copy the link
  2. Open terminal and cd to your desired location and type "git clone *insert copied link*
  3. cd into new folder created
  
ALWAYS REMEMBER TO MAKE SURE YOUR CODE IS UP TO DATE BEFORE DOING ANYTHING ELSE:
  - git pull origin main
  
  
If you want to create a new branch to work on a part of the project so we aren't using main:
  1. type in the console "git checkout DesiredBranchName" to either create or switch to the branch for ex i have a branch called homePage so thats where we can make edits to the homePage
  
  1.5: if you created a new branch, must type:
      - git push --set-upstream origin server      in order to have that branch accessible to everyone
  
  2. once whatever you entered works, type:
      - git add .
      - "git commit -m "Enter a message of what was done""
      - git push
      - git checkout main
      - git merge server
      - git push -u origin main
